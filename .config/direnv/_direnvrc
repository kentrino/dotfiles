# Looks like you are using the 'asdf direnv hook asdf' command which was removed in asdf-direnv 0.3.0.                                                                                
# You might want to run 'asdf direnv setup' again. See the README for instructions on updating.
# Also, be sure to remove the old integration from '~/.config/direnv/direnvrc'. Look for a line that reads 'asdf direnv hook asdf'.
# The new setup command will use (and automatically manage) '~/.config/direnv/lib/use_asdf.sh' instead, 
# source "$(asdf direnv hook asdf)"
